COVID-19 has impacted our lives for the past year and is here to stay, with many variants of the virus emerging. Many countries have ongoing efforts to vaccinate their population and some countries have resorted to a mix of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs)-lockdowns, sealed borders, wearing of masks, to control the spread of the virus.

Our project aim to explore these two topics: 1) the correlation between countriesâ€™ development indicators and their pandemic situations, and 2) the differentiating success factors in controlling the spread of the virus. We take a global approach by combining various data sources and analysing the effect of the various factors on the virus (as compared to most location specific simulation studies)

The code for the decision tree above combines a variety of factors including development indicators (GDP, HDI etc.) healthcare indicators (cardiovascular death rate and ratio of Female and Male smokers, Hospital beds per thousand) as well as measures put in place by governments NPIs and the vaccination progress(new vaccinations per million)  to find out which combination of factors have the largest efffect on contraining the spread and effects of the virus. The response variables used were new deaths per million and new cases per million.

Our study found that stringy index (NPIs) new vaccinations per million and  GDP per capita played a huge role in predicting new COVID cases, whereas for prediction new deaths per million, proportion of the population aged 70 and older, NPIs and new vaccination had an impact, showing the disporpotionate effect of COVID on certain groups.

We have also provided visualisations in the form of dashboards for users to perform desciptive analysis on the data. The data is updated till Apr 2021.
